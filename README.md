# Savings-Yield-Calculator

Hello everyone!

I designed this calculator to assume a daily deposit to an investment account with an annual percentage yield.

The expected annual yield is divided by all 365 days of the year to assume a daily return.

Also, you can set a percentage increase in daily deposits per year.

Take a look at the finished product:
